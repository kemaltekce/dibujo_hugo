The tool that help me find enough - after trying a bunch of productivity tools that never felt right - is the Bullet Journal Method. \n\n I'm a fan of bullet journaling and I use it day-by-day. The goal of dibujo is to try bring the same intentional experience to the digital space. If you are avoiding pen and paper, I hope dibujo can bring intentionality and the feeling of enough into your life from a digital angle."
